"""Pattern / recipe library for complex formr runs.

These patterns **inform** the agent — they are not copy-paste templates. Real deployments
differ too much (survey names, study_ids, item lists, positions) for a fixed unit blueprint to
drop in cleanly. Instead each pattern describes the *approach*: the structure (which unit types,
in what order, with which key fields), the reusable R idioms that are the genuinely portable
part, the gotchas, and — where relevant — which repeating R to factor into the run's `custom_r`
store so the run stays DRY. The agent reads a pattern, then builds units adapted to the
specific run with the normal editing tools.

Patterns are mined from real working runs in ``improvement_materials/``. Two conventions recur:

* ``type_options`` is a **string**, never a raw int. On a ``submit`` item it means auto-submit:
  ``"1"`` (~1 ms, used to create a page boundary), ``"800"``/``"2000"`` (ms delay, polling),
  ``"auto"`` (submit as soon as a choice is made). On a ``number`` item it means
  ``"min,max,step"``. Same field, different meaning per item type.
* ``formr_api_fetch_results(surveys = c(...), join = TRUE)`` renames columns to
  ``<item>_<survey>``. Reference the renamed columns, and count only completed participants
  when balancing.
